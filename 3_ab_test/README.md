**Motivation:** Conversion rates are crucial for optimizing user engagement and achieving business goals. 
This project involved conducting an A/B test to evaluate whether there was a significant difference in conversion rates between 
two different landing pages. The goal was to determine which page design led to higher user conversions and to provide data-driven 
recommendations for improving page effectiveness.

## **The essence of AB Testing**

In its essence, AB testing involves seperating an audience into two groups, group A and group B. Each group will experience two different experiences, in our case, two different landing pages.
The researchers who perform the AB test are looking for changes in key performance metrics which suggest preferences from the audience.
