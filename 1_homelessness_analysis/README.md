# Analysis of Homelessness Relief Figures (2024)
## **Motivation:** 

Homelessness is a pressing social issue, and I wanted to understand how government spending impacts homelessness rates across different regions. This project involves a time-series analysis of relief spending relative to housing procurement and a geographical analysis of homelessness figures across the UK. The goal was to identify trends and disparities that could inform policy decisions.

## **Homlessness Rates Across England**

With a new Labour Party government recently elected, building homes is at the top of the agenda as property prices and living costs skyrocket,
all of this is in an effort to reduce purchase and rental costs with intent to alleviate the burden of UK residents.

UK house prices reached around Â£262,000 in 2024 compared to 181,000 in 2007.

January 2024 saw an inflation rate of 7%.

It is fair to say that the new government has a hard job ahead of them, with the previous government failing to resolve the growing demand for houses.
But what about the people who are the most at risk?

## **Homelessness in the UK**
A 2024 report by the government dating back to August 2024 provides data on owed relief and homeless figures from the second quarter of 2018 to the first quarter of 2024.<br>

Before we go further into the report, it is important to know that owed relief is the money assessed owed by the government to UK residents who are threatened with homelessnessor currently homeless. 
We use this measure as an estimate of government spending on homlessness previention and relief.<br>

By analysing the regional data, we can get a quick glimpse at what areas are most affected by homelessness.

We can see that the North-East is most affected by homelessness. This is likely due to historical shifts in the UK economy which pushed jobs towards other regions.

Looking at the median house price to median residence earning ratio, we can see that this is not directly due to housing affordability.
A high ratio would suggest the price is higher relative to earnings, meaning housing is less affordable.

The North East has the lowest ratio which tells us there housing is more affordable than in other regions. This suggests the higher homeless rate might be more due to social reasons such as access to social care, family support, and government support.

## **Spending on homelessness prevention and relief**

We selected the assessed total owed relief measure to represent government spending on prevention and relief. The tree map below shows the proportion of spending across regions.

London spent the most on relief and prevention with around 21% of total spending. The differences in spending most likely due to population and cost of living disparities across regions.

As we can see from the chart the London has a population of around 9 million, comparable to the South East. Whilst, other regions are less populated, the North East holding a population of nearly 3 million.

Cost of living disparities is best represented using the average private rent.

source: [ONS GOV UK - Private Rent and House Prices - 2024](https://www.ons.gov.uk/economy/inflationandpriceindices/bulletins/privaterentandhousepricesuk/august2024)

London has the highest private rent costs, meaning securing housing for individuals at risk is more expensive if there is not enough council housing.

From are previous analysis we can identify key insights on the geographic nature of homelessness.

- Different regions are affected more than others, the North East has the highest homeless rate at 0.22%

- The reason is most likely due to social issues such as lack of access to care, family support and government relief.

- Spending on prevention and relief measures is different across regions, mostly due to population and cost of living disparities, London and the South East being the most costly.

Now that we better understand the most affected regions and the spending associated with each area, let's look at the demographics, specifically which age group is most likely to be at risk of homelessness.

## **Demographics of people at risk of homelessness**

Looking at the demographic distribution through a pie chart, gives us a clearer idea of which age group is more at risk of being homeless.

As we see from the chart, the population most at risk is between the ages of 25 and 44. This is probably the result of unemployment rates among these age groups.
