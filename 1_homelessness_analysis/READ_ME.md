## 1. Analysis of Homelessness Relief Figures (2024)
**Motivation:** Homelessness is a pressing social issue, and I wanted to understand how government spending impacts homelessness rates across different regions. This project involves a time-series analysis of relief spending relative to housing procurement and a geographical analysis of homelessness figures across the UK. The goal was to identify trends and disparities that could inform policy decisions.
