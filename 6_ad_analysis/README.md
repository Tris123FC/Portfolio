## 6. Analysis of Ad Revenue Across Media Streams

**Motivation:** The allocation of advertising budgets across different media channels—such as TV, radio, and newspapers—plays a critical role in shaping marketing strategies and maximizing ROI. This project explores ad revenue data to understand how investments are distributed among these media streams and their relative performance. By analyzing historical revenue trends and patterns, the project aims to provide insights that can help advertisers and media planners make informed decisions about future ad spend.
