# Portfolio Projects

## 1. Analysis of Homelessness Relief Figures
**Motivation:** Homelessness is a pressing social issue, and I wanted to understand how government spending impacts homelessness rates across different regions. This project involves a time-series analysis of relief spending relative to housing procurement and a geographical analysis of homelessness figures across the UK. The goal was to identify trends and disparities that could inform policy decisions.

## 2. Analysis of Tech Sector Stock Market

**Motivation:** The tech industry plays a crucial role in the global economy, and I wanted to explore how market trends impact the stock prices of major tech companies like Facebook, Google, Amazon, and Microsoft. This project involves a detailed analysis of stock price movements over time, with a focus on identifying patterns and factors influencing these trend. I then proceed to test the predictions of an LSTM machine learning model on future stock prices by comparing the prediction with the actual values of stock prices. The goal is to provide insights that could guide investment decisions and a deeper understanding of the tech market landscape.

## 3. A/B Test on Landing Page Conversion Rates

**Motivation:** Conversion rates are crucial for optimizing user engagement and achieving business goals. This project involved conducting an A/B test to evaluate whether there was a significant difference in conversion rates between two different landing pages. The goal was to determine which page design led to higher user conversions and to provide data-driven recommendations for improving page effectiveness.

## 4. Analysis of HSK5 Target Vocabulary Frequency in Intermediate / Advanced Texts

**Motivation:** Understanding and mastering the vocabulary for the HSK5 (Hànyǔ Shuǐpíng Kǎoshì Level 5) Chinese proficiency exam is crucial for learners aiming to reach advanced language skills. This analysis involved examining the target vocabulary of the HSK5 level and assessing their frequency in both intermediate and advanced texts. By analyzing the occurrence of these words in different text complexities, the project aimed to uncover trends in vocabulary usage, determine which words are most critical for achieving fluency, and provide insights for more effective language learning strategies. The goal was to guide learners and educators in optimizing study plans and ensuring better preparation for real-world language use.
