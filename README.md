## 3. A/B Test on Landing Page Conversion Rates

**Motivation:** Conversion rates are crucial for optimizing user engagement and achieving business goals. This project involved conducting an A/B test to evaluate whether there was a significant difference in conversion rates between two different landing pages. The goal was to determine which page design led to higher user conversions and to provide data-driven recommendations for improving page effectiveness.
