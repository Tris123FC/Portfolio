## 1. Analysis of Homelessness Relief Figures (2024)
**Motivation:** Homelessness is a pressing social issue, and I wanted to understand how government spending impacts homelessness rates across different regions. This project involves a time-series analysis of relief spending relative to housing procurement and a geographical analysis of homelessness figures across the UK. The goal was to identify trends and disparities that could inform policy decisions.

## 2. Classification of Plant Growth Using Machine Learning

**Motivation:** Understanding plant growth is essential for improving agricultural practices and ensuring crop yield. This project involved developing a machine learning model to classify plant growth stages based on various features such as soil quality, water availability, and environmental conditions. The aim was to provide insights that could enhance farming strategies and contribute to more efficient plant cultivation.
